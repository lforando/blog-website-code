Engineer working on diverse R&D projects in the field of underwater acoustics and hydrodynamics.

Software engineering experience developing sonar/radar/lidar signal processing algorithms, numerical algorithms for tracking and state estimation, performing underwater radiated noise analysis and writing software for real-time data acquisition, GPS time keeping and signal pre-processing.

Graduate of the University of Connecticut with a B.S. in Applied Mathematics with additional coursework in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Fluency with Matlab, Python, and C programing languages. 

I parallel my career in engineering with volunteer positions in the field of education. I have an interest in education policies and curriculum development; specifically in a private secondary school environment and in higher education, from my time in both of these institutions.
