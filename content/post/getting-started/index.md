**Hello!**

Welcome to "Confessions of an Aspiring Data Scientist." I am so excited to share this project. I originally entered college intending to be pre-med. As I took more classes, I realized that I was more interested in research, specifically in data and psychological topics. At the end of my freshman year I was asked to join a research team for the Smith College School of Social Work. I worked on this project for a year and a half. At the same time, I was working in this lab, I also began taking more statistics courses. It was here that I fell in love with statistics. Something about the pureness of numbers and universality of their meaning intrigued me. Luckily for me, my school offers a major in Statistical and Data Sciences. I decided to declare this as my major and dive headfirst in math and computer science courses. I created this platform with the vision of a place where college students and individuals interested in data science could come and gain some insight. Data science is a hot topic word but what is it? This question is the main reason I decided to start this project. On this site you will find:

- links to podcasts
- interviews with data scientists, engineers, mathematicians, and computer scientists
- blog posts relating to the many application areas data science can be applied to
- advice from current and recently graduated college students in the field
- videos covering content in statistics, R code, and much more

I hope you enjoy this website and find it informative and beneficial. If there is a specific topic you would like to be covered, submit a blog post, ask a question, or leave a comment in general, please feel free to contact us.

Happy coding! ☺️👩🏼
